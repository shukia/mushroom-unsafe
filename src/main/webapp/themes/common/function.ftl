 * This file consists of a collection of FreeMarker macros aimed at easing
 * some of the common requirements of web applications - in particular
 * handling of forms.
 *
 * Spring's FreeMarker support will automatically make this file and therefore
 * all macros within it available to any application using Spring's
 * FreeMarkerConfigurer.
 *
 * To take advantage of these macros, the "exposeSpringMacroHelpers" property
 * of the FreeMarker class needs to be set to "true". This will expose a
 * RequestContext under the name "springMacroRequestContext", as needed by
 * the macros in this library.
